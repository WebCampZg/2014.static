  <h2>The first talks, supporter packs, english only and much much more </h2>
  <time>07.07.2014.</time>
  <p>
    We at WebCamp Zagreb are really happy to say that the interest for the conference has been excellent. We’ve received over 50 talks proposals in our first CFP round, plus we’ve cooked up some new ideas we’re announcing right now. Get ready for the first batch of speakers, plus <em>supporter packs</em> and a 2-day conference + a day of workshops!
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, you’ve read that correctly - we’re planning to do a full-blown 2-day conference, raising the bar significantly compared to the previous two years! Encouraged by the quality of the talks we’ve received through the first round of CFP, we’d really like to have all those awesome people coming to Zagreb in October.
  </p>
  <h3>Supporter Packs for a 2-day conference</h3>
  <p>
    Making that happen requires some additional support. Support from the community we’re doing this conference for, and that’s you. For this purpose, we’ve come up with a complimentary package consisting of an official WebCamp Zagreb T-shirt (a lot of you asked if you could get one last year), some cool user groups badges, stickers and other potential surprises, plus a free ticket included.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s our proposal - if we can have <strong>over 300 supporter packs</strong> sold <strong>by August 10th</strong>, when we’ll be announcing our complete speakers lineup, we’re going to do a 2-day conference (Saturday + Sunday)! If you like the deal, head to Entrio and <a href="https://www.entrio.hr/en/event/webcamp-zagreb-2014-1579" target="_blank">get your supporter pack now</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conference tickets will remain free, and while the supporter pack makes it convenient to secure your ticket by supporting the conference, we’ll reserve at least 200 free tickets that will be released early September on a first-come, first-served basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <h3>Workshops and a Week of WebCamp</h3>
  <p>
    We’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be doing ‘more than just a conference’ - we wish to make the whole week filled with developers’ events, and we’ve taken steps in that direction. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can already announce that we’ll be organizing <strong>WebCamp Workshops</strong> on Friday before the conference. Some topics have been confirmed, but we’re still working on the full lineup, so we’ll keep quiet for now, except for the fact that we’re doing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we’re working with all our user groups to hold <strong>extended meetups</strong> in the week prior to the conference weekend, with a focus of getting some international speakers with more language specific topics than talks at the conference.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Week of Webcamp and workshop events will be happening at the HGK (Croatian Chamber of Commerce) building, where we held our first edition of the WebCamp conference. Getting back to the roots...
  </p>
  
  
  
  <h3>Speakers</h3>
  <p>
    First, we’d like to thank all of the speakers who have proposed their talks for their effort, we’ve really had tough time selecting the most interesting topics. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Before announcing our speakers, we wish to remind you all that the CFP is still open till August 1st, and we’re <a href="http://2014.webcampzg.org/cfp/index.html#content" target="_blank" >encouraging you to apply</a>, we’re sure you have something interesting to talk about. 
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, here’s the list of our speakers selected in the first round:
  </p>
  <p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anna Chiara Bellini: Gaming a drone simulator</li>
		<li>Veljko Dragšić: Beyond GET</li>
		<li>Sebastian Göttschkes: Vagrant to the rescue</li>
		<li>Marko Ivankovic: Measuring Test Coverage at Google</li>
		<li>Nikica Jokić: Aggregating data consistently and accountably</li>
		<li>Saša Jurić: Thinking in actors</li>
		<li>Jonn Mostovoy: The Modern Approaches to the Javascript Problem</li>
		<li>Luka Mužinić: Dashboards for devops and other web folks</li>
		<li>Nikola Plejić: How, When, and Why Clojure?</li>
		<li>Marijan Šuflaj: Redis in practice</li>
		<li>Zdeslav Vojković: ZeroMQ - toolset for high-performance distributed applications</li>
		<li>Srđan Vranac: Ansible, just orchestrate it</li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We’re confident that we’ve made an interesting selection for you, and we know there are lot more great talks in the queue already.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, once more, we’d like to repeat our proposal - <strong>let us have over 300 Supporter Packs sold, and we’ll give you a 2-day conference!</strong> Even some of our selected speakers have already expressed their support by buying a Supporter Pack, big kudos to them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, it’s up to you - </strong><a href="https://www.entrio.hr/en/event/webcamp-zagreb-2014-1579" target="_blank">show us that you’re awesome, too</a></strong>!
