    <h3>Talks info</h3>

    <h4>Frontend &amp; JavaScript</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt>Josip Maslać: Desktop first, responsive later - naučene lekcije</dt>
      <dd>Na predavanju će biti ispričano na koje smo sve izazove naišli
      prilikom izrade responzivne verzije stranica Nabava.net s naglaskom na to
      kako smo ih riješili i što smo pri tome naučili.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Darko Kukovec: Conquering CSS debugging</dt>
      <dd>Debugging CSS can be really hard when you face the fact that there are
      lot of browsers, devices and screen resolutions available. Based on my experience
      and needs, I've built a tool that can modify pages CSS across multiple browsers
      simultaneously, and also provide feedback from the browser and show what property
      is really being used.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Martina Jović: Sustainable web design</dt>
      <dd>Every website has its own carbon footprint, why don’t we make it
      less as possible and still create good design? Efficiency is a priority
      at all levels, from art to code. Sustainable web process is minimising
      environmental impact and maximising value for clients and audience,
      but also follows strategies for site creation and maintenance so they
      can serve their purpose today and in the future. Sustainability and
      good design are compatible.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Hrvoje Gazibara: Visualizing data on the Web</dt>
      <dd>The talk describes how Web technologies can help us design more
      creative and interactive data visualizations. Javascript, combined with
      SVG, WebGL, and the like, makes it easy to visualize data in an eye-catching
      and interactive way. This talk introduces some interesting ideas, techniques
      and technologies that can make users' eye pop.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Andrej Radišić: Ministry of sound case study</dt>
      <dd>The talk is about showing the whole process we went with the client,
      and a discussion why we choose some non standard patterns. Also It's about
      what software and props we use in our process, the problems we came across
      (internally and with the client), and how to solve them.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Tomislav Mesić: Decoupling Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>Any non-trivial site or application on the Web today will contain
      a large amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the use of the Internet
      evolves and our dependence on it increases, having a plan for organizing
      and maintaining your front-end code is an absolute must.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Python</h4>

    <dl>
      <dt>Ivan Mesic: Log your (apps) brains out</dt>
      <dd>A big app is usually composed of many components running on many
      different servers. How one goes about setting up logging on all of
      those servers while keeping it simple? We will setup Elasticsearch and
      Logstash to accept and store all of your logs so that they can be analyzed
      and "pretty printed" with Kibana. We will also prepare your Python
      logging system so developers don't need to learn anything new.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Deni Bertovic: Python Metaclasses for fun and profit</dt>
      <dd>Chances are Metaclasses are that one feature in Python you've heard about
      but never got the chance to explore. Perhaps it's because they are too esoteric
      or hard to find a use case for. Even though you might never need them it's nice
      to know that powerful stuff like this is possible with Python. In this talk
      I will explain what metaclasses are, how they are used and what they bring to
      the table using a couple of real world examples.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Darko Ronić: Mobile games to the Cloud with Python</dt>
      <dd>When a mobile game development company decides to switch to a more
      cloud based development it is faced with obstacles different from those
      it’s used to on mobile devices. This talk explains how Python provided us
      with most of the infrastructure for this task and how a Python game backend
      was built as a result.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Senko Rašić: Detecting duplicate queries in Django ORM</dt>
      <dd>Django ORM is a powerful tool to abstract away dealing with the database,
      but if used improperly, will happily let you generate thousands of SQL queries
      where one or two might suffice. The price of power is eternal vigilance - this
      talk will show you how.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>Robert Lujo: Development environment for Django project - my way</dt>
      <dd>This talk will try to cover the most important techniques and best practices
      used when creating Django web application: development general principles and goals;
      Django project initial setup; central project shell command; "IDE" - editor &amp; shell;
      edit/run/test cycle and deploy/test-remotely cycle. Disclaimer: techniques and practices
      presented are current AUTHOR'S optimal choice used for usual django project.</dd>
    </dl>
