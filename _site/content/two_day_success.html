<article>
  <p>
    The crowdfunding campaign ended yesterday at midnight, and we’re proud to announce the second conference day at this year’s WebCamp Zagreb conference. We’re now bringing you the third round of speakers.
  </p>
  <h3>Crowdfunding campaign results</h3>
  <p>
    As you probably know, a crowdfunding campaign was organized to confirm your interest in having a world-class 2-day conference experience in Zagreb. The main purpose of the campaign was to cover the costs of the venue for the second day, which are not negligible. After five weeks of expectation, we finally reached the goal in the last week of the campaign, but it wasn't easy. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We have sold over 200 Supporter Packs, and thanks to additional direct support from two of our community members, we have reached our goal and overshot it. Huuuuge thanks to the everyone who supported us and shown us that you wish WebCamp to grow!
  </p>

 <h3>Tickets info</h3>

 <p>
  And a final note regarding Supporter Packs and tickets availability - we’re keeping <b>Supporter Packs</b> available for people who still wish to support the conference (all the funds collected this way are going towards improving the conference experience), and get their own supporter T-shirt (they’re available only through this offer, and <b>won’t</b> be sold at the conference) plus their free conference ticket included. As the crowdfunding campaign has finished, the new Supporter Pack price is <b>300 HRK/ 40 EUR / $55</b>, starting tomorrow, and available until free tickets get released.</p>
  <p>
   <b>Free tickets</b> will be released early September (stay tuned for the exact date and time). The exact number depends on the amount of the remaining tickets released free through our communities, for people who’ve been active in them throughout the year; but as we’ve promised, there will be <b>a minimum of 200 free tickets</b> available this way.

  </p>
  <h3>And yet another ‘Thank you’!</h3>
  <p>Once again, thank you all who participated in the crowdfunding campaign and made all this possible! We’ll do our best to reward you with an exceptional conference experience this October in Zagreb.</p>
