<h2 class="section-title">Call for Papers</h2>
<article>
  <p>
  It’s a great pleasure to invite you to WebCamp Zagreb 2014, a tech conference devoted to web development & design, which will be held on October 4th 2014 in Zagreb, Croatia. This is a call to participate: help us build a great conference once again by becoming a speaker! With great opportunities to network with fellow developers & designers the most important part of every great conference are expert talks. And free pizzas.

  </p>
  <p>
  It’s all about the community, WebCamp Zagreb is organized by local user groups:  <a title="Code@Six" href="http://codeatsix.infinum.hr/meetup">Code@Six</a>, <a title="Frontman HR" href="http://www.frontman-hr.org/">FrontmanHr</a>, <a title="Future DEV" href="http://www.mscommunity.hr/">FutureDEV</a>, <a title="Girl Geek Dinners Hrvatska" href="http://croatia.girlgeekdinners.com/">Girl Geek Dinners Hrvatska</a>, <a title="HUJAK" href="http://hujak.hr/">HUJAK</a>, <a title="JavaScript Zagreb" href="https://twitter.com/jszgb">Javascript Zagreb</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Python-Hrvatska/">Python Hrvatska</a> and <a title="ZgPHP" href="http://zgphp.org/">ZgPHP</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
  Before inviting the first visitors, we have to build a great collection of talks.

  </p>
  <p>
  This is where we need your help. We need your talk; or more of them. Feel free to submit all of your ideas, we have a diverse range of interests so all submissions are welcome! While it’s not important which technology, language or tool you use, let your suggestions be interesting and fresh to a broad audience. Just make the talk web related (even if it’s a long shot). We love first hand experience talks!

  </p>
  <p>
  Talks should be of a technical nature, not promotional. Try to cover both good and bad sides and keep the presentation as objective as possible. If you want to present a specific project, give us an inside perspective. Just keep in mind that we’re looking for tech talks, not sales pitches.

  </p>
  <p>
  Here’s some ideas to get you started: application architecture, hosting, cloud solutions, software development methodology, application testing, development/design tools, design, client and server side development, mobile web, specific technologies/tools/libraries, SQL or NoSQL databases and data storages, tech experience you love or dislike, managing or web team organization, collaboration tools, distributed or remote teamwork experiences.

  </p>
  <p>
  All talks are 25 minutes long and this includes the Q&amp;A at the end. This limitation will be strictly enforced to keep the conference schedule on track. It’s highly recommended to limit your talk to 20 minutes to allow 5 minutes for Q&amp;A.
  </p>
  <p>
  Proposals can be submitted through the <a title="Application Form" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1C7cxlokD1DWfG3bUyMN-Le5VIFY4YlR8jxMxMQC4Y-U/viewform">CFP Application Form</a>.
  </p>
  <b>Increase your chances by submitting proposals early!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Selection process this year will be a bit different. Although the call for papers ends on August 1st there will be an additional early bird selection round on July 1st. Proposals submitted upto that date will be voted upon first. Selected speakers can expect emails a few days later, and selected talks will be published after speaker confirmation. All the remaining proposals and those submitted after July 1st will be voted on when the call for papers ends, on August 1st.
  </p>
  <p>
  Proposals are evaluated and rated by representatives of each organizing user group. Selected speakers will be contacted directly via e-mail soon after each round.
