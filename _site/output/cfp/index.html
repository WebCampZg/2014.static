  <p>
  It’s a great pleasure to invite you to WebCamp Zagreb 2014, a tech conference devoted to web development & design, which will be held on October 4th 2014 in Zagreb, Croatia. This is a call to participate: help us build a great conference once again by becoming a speaker! With great opportunities to network with fellow developers & designers the most important part of every great conference are expert talks. And free pizzas.

  </p>
  <p>
  It’s all about the community, WebCamp Zagreb is organized by local user groups:  <a title="Code@Six" href="http://codeatsix.infinum.hr/meetup">Code@Six</a>, <a title="Frontman HR" href="http://www.frontman-hr.org/">FrontmanHr</a>, <a title="Future DEV" href="http://www.mscommunity.hr/">FutureDEV</a>, <a title="Girl Geek Dinners Hrvatska" href="http://croatia.girlgeekdinners.com/">Girl Geek Dinners Hrvatska</a>, <a title="HUJAK" href="http://hujak.hr/">HUJAK</a>, <a title="JavaScript Zagreb" href="https://twitter.com/jszgb">Javascript Zagreb</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Python-Hrvatska/">Python Hrvatska</a> and <a title="ZgPHP" href="http://zgphp.org/">ZgPHP</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
  Before inviting the first visitors, we have to build a great collection of talks.

  </p>
  <p>
  This is where we need your help. We need your talk; or more of them. Feel free to submit all of your ideas, we have a diverse range of interests so all submissions are welcome! While it’s not important which technology, language or tool you use, let your suggestions be interesting and fresh to a broad audience. Just make the talk web related (even if it’s along shot). We love first hand experience talks!

  </p>
  <p>
  Talks should be of a technical nature, not promotional. Try to cover both good and bad sides and keep the presentation as objective as possible. If you want to present a specific project, give us an inside perspective. Just keep in mind that we’re looking for tech talks, not sales pitches.

  </p>
  <p>
  Here’s some ideas to get you started: application architecture, hosting, cloud solutions, software development methodology, application testing, development/design tools, design, client and server side development, mobile web, specific technologies/tools/libraries, SQL or NoSQL databases and data storages, tech experience you love or dislike, managing or web team organization, collaboration tools, distributed or remote teamwork experiences.

  </p>
  <p>
  All talks are 25 minutes long and this includes the Q&amp;A at the end. This limitation will be strictly enforced to keep the conference schedule on track. It’s highly recommended to limit your talk to 20 minutes to allow 5 minutes for Q&amp;A.
  </p>
  <p>
  Proposals can be submitted through the <a title="Application Form" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1C7cxlokD1DWfG3bUyMN-Le5VIFY4YlR8jxMxMQC4Y-U/viewform">CFP Application Form</a>. Call for paper ends on August 1st 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
  Proposals are evaluated and rated by representatives of each organizing user group. Selected speakers will be contacted directly via e-mail by August 15th. 
  </p>
